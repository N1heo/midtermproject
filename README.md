# This is my midterm project

So, the idea is to create simulation-game.
Right now, I'm still thinking about the games idea. 

## Test idea
I took the main idea from Game Of Life and code from my teacher's example of recreating game of life on python.

## What i did
Well, I started by adding preset function. I did that using tkinter **bind** method . After that, I made it possible to start or stop the game, so user could make presets without sells dying immediately. Making some tests, i find out that the game doesn't behave like conway's, there was a mistake in the sum line. After fixing it and having completely working game of life I started to work on my own rules of the game.

## Idea
The idea that came into my head was to create something like a human organism simulation. I'd wanted to add blood cells, viruses and bacterias and make some random chanches to any of them win. 

## I added:
- this
- that
- this
